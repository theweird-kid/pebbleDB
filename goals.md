📐 High-level architecture layers (bottom → top)
🔷 1. Storage Layer (Data and Logs)
This is the foundation.
Responsible for reliably storing and fetching bytes — both data and logs.

Components:
Page Manager / Buffer Manager

You already have an in-memory B+ Tree → next: put its nodes into fixed-size pages (commonly 4KB/8KB).

Implements: load, flush, evict, cache of pages.

Supports reading and writing pages to disk files.

Handles page allocation & free lists.

File System abstraction

Maps DB pages to OS files.

Manages WAL (Write-Ahead Log) and data files.

Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

Every change is first written sequentially to a WAL.

Ensures Durability even if the process crashes.

Can replay WAL on startup to recover.

🔷 2. Data Structures & Access Methods
This is where your B+ Tree lives — and others like:

Heap files → unordered storage (for tables).

B+ Tree → ordered indexes.

Hash Indexes → for quick equality lookups.

Tasks:
Support insert/delete/update/search in indexes and tables.

Manage free space in pages.

Support multiple indexes on a table.

Maintain consistency between indexes & tables.

🔷 3. Transaction & Concurrency Control
This is where we implement ACID properties:

Atomicity

Use WAL + undo/redo logging.

Changes of a transaction are either fully applied or fully undone.

Consistency

Your constraints (foreign keys, etc.) + correct implementation.

Isolation

Allow concurrent transactions to run as if serialized.

Common methods:

Locks (2PL – two-phase locking)

MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)

Serializable isolation levels.

Deadlock detection & prevention.

Durability

WAL + checkpoints ensure committed data survives crashes.

Key components here:
Transaction Manager: assigns transaction IDs, tracks active transactions.

Lock Manager: enforces locking rules.

MVCC Manager (optional): maintains multiple versions of rows.

🔷 4. Query Processing & Optimizer
Above the storage + concurrency layers is the query engine:

SQL Parser → parse SQL into AST.

Query Planner → convert AST to a plan.

Optimizer → choose efficient plan (index scans, joins, etc.).

Executor → actually runs the plan by calling into storage/index layers.

🔷 5. API / Interface Layer
Exposes SQL or an API to the user.

Manages client connections, sessions, transactions.

🚀 Suggested Roadmap (Phase-wise)
Now that you know the layers, here’s a logical progression you can follow:

📄 Phase 1 — Storage Engine
✅ B+ Tree (in-memory) → done
🔷 Next:

Add page abstraction & page layout.

Store B+ tree nodes in pages.

Write pages to disk (persistent storage).

Implement a WAL.

Implement buffer pool with LRU eviction.

Support crash recovery (replay WAL).

📄 Phase 2 — Transaction Manager
Implement basic transactions.

Use WAL for atomicity & durability.

Support BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK.

Implement locks or MVCC for isolation.

📄 Phase 3 — Concurrency & Isolation
Implement proper isolation levels:

Read Committed

Repeatable Read

Serializable

Detect & resolve deadlocks.

Add MVCC for higher concurrency if desired.

📄 Phase 4 — SQL & Query Processor
Build SQL parser.

Simple planner & executor.

Run basic queries: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

Support indexes during query execution.

📄 Phase 5 — Advanced
Optimizer: better plans.

Joins, aggregations, etc.

Distributed (optional).

📚 In Summary
Layer	Responsibility
🗄 Storage	Pages, disk, WAL, buffer pool
📊 Access Methods	B+ trees, heap files, indexes
🔄 Transactions	ACID, locking, MVCC
🧠 Query Engine	Parsing, planning, execution
🌐 Interface	SQL protocol, sessions

💡 Notes for You
You already have a B+ tree in memory → now make it page-based & persistent.

Build WAL early → it enables recovery & transactions.

Use fixed-size pages and start with a single file DB.

Start with lock-based concurrency, then later try MVCC.
